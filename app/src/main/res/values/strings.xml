    <string name="whatIsCVitamin">Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin. This means that it dissolves in water and is not well stored, so it must be taken daily through food or supplements. Because your body doesn\'t produce vitamin C, you need to get it from your diet.\u00E2\u0080\u00A8\u00E2\u0080\u00A8Vitamin C deficiency results in impaired immunity and higher susceptibility to infections. </string>
    <string name="whatIsRiText">100%RI tells you the minimum amount of a vitamin that is required to avoid deficiency in the majority of the population. <b>Achieving 80 mg (100%RI) of Vitamin C, is comparable to eating half a small bell pepper.</b></string>
    <string name="WhatIsUpperLimitText">The UL (<b>Tolerable Upper Intake Level</b>) for vitamin C is between 1.000 and 2.000 mg. Taking large amounts (more than 1,000mg per day) of vitamin C <b>can cause stomach pain and diarrhoea.</b> These symptoms should disappear once you stop taking vitamin C supplements.</string>
